Description: Corrects GC and mappability biases for readcounts (i.e. coverage) in non-overlapping windows of fixed length for single whole genome samples, yielding a rough estimate of copy number for furthur analysis.  Designed for rapid correction of high coverage whole genome tumour and normal samples.
